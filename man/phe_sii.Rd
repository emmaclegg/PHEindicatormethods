\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame containing the data to calculate slope index of inequality from, pre-grouped if
multiple DSRs required; unquoted string; no default}

\item{quantile}{field name within data that contains the quantile label (e.g. decile). The number
of quantiles should be between 5 and 100; unquoted string; no default}

\item{population}{field name within data that contains the quantile populations (ie, denominator).
Non-zero populations are required for all quantiles to calculate SII for an area;
unquoted string; no default}

\item{x}{(for indicators that are proportions) field name within data that contains
the members of the population with the attribute of interest (ie, numerator). This will be
divided by population to calculate a proportion as the indicator value
(if value field is not provided); unquoted string; no default}

\item{value}{field name within data that contains the indicator value (this does not need to be supplied
for proportions if count and population are given); unquoted string; no default}

\item{value_type}{indicates the indicator type (1 = rate, 2 = proportion, 0 = other);
integer; default 0}

\item{lower_cl}{field name within data that contains 95\% lower confidence limit
of indicator value (to calculate standard error of indicator value). This field is needed
if the se field is not supplied; unquoted string; no default}

\item{upper_cl}{field name within data that contains 95\% upper confidence limit
of indicator value (to calculate standard error of indicator value). This field is needed
if the se field is not supplied; unquoted string; no default}

\item{se}{field name within data that contains the standard error of the indicator
value. If not supplied, this will be calculated from the 95\% lower and upper confidence
limits (i.e. one or the other of these fields must be supplied); unquoted string; no default}

\item{multiplier}{factor to multiply the SII and SII confidence limits by (e.g. set to 100 to return
prevalences on a percentage scale between 0 and 100). If the multiplier is negative, the
inverse of the RII is taken to account for the change in polarity; numeric; default 1;}

\item{repetitions}{number of random samples to perform to return confidence interval of SII;
numeric; default 100,000}

\item{confidence}{confidence level used to calculate the lower and upper confidence limits of SII;
numeric between 0.5 and 0.9999 or 50 and 99.99; default 0.95}

\item{rii}{option to return the Relative Index of Inequality (RII) with associated confidence limits
as well as the SII; logical; default FALSE}

\item{reliability_stat}{option to carry out the SII confidence interval simulation 10 times instead
of once and return the Mean Average Difference between the first and subsequent samples (as a
measure of the amount of variation). Warning: this will significantly increase run time of the
function and should first be tested on a small number of repetitions; logical; default FALSE}

\item{type}{"full" output includes columns in the output dataset specifying the parameters the user
has input to the function (value_type, multiplier, CI_confidence, CI_method); character string
either "full" or "standard"; default "full"}
}
\value{
The SII with lower and upper confidence limits for each subgroup of the inputted data.frame.
}
\description{
\code{phe_sii} returns the slope index of inequality (SII) statistic for each subgroup
of the inputted dataframe, with lower and upper confidence limits based on the specified
confidence. The Relative Index of Inequality (RII) can also be returned via an optional
argument.
}
\details{
The SII and RII are two measures of health inequality. They show the relation
between the level of health or frequency of a health problem in different
population groups and the ranking of these groups on the social scale.

The input dataframe should be grouped before passing to the function if an SII/RII for
each subgroup is required, and quantiles ordered from least to most advantaged.
}
\section{Calculation}{

The SII is calculated using linear regression [1]. To allow
for differences in population size between quantiles (e.g. deprivation deciles),
each is given a rank score (or relative rank) based on the midpoint of its range
in the cumulative distribution of the total area population. The quantiles are
first ordered (e.g from 1 most deprived to 10 least deprived for deprivation deciles).
If quantile 1 then contains 12\% of the total population, its relative rank is
  \code{0.12/2=0.6}. If quantile 2 includes 10\% of the population, its relative rank
is  \code{0.12+(0.10/2)=0.17}. A square root transformation is applied to the regression
to account for heteroskedasticity (the tendancy for the variances of the quantile values
to be related to the size of the values, ie larger values will tend to have larger
variances). A regression model is fitted to the transformed data:  \eqn{Y * \sqrt a =
\sqrt a + b * \sqrt a}, where Y is the value of the indicator for the quantile, a is
the proportion of the total population in the quantile and b is the relative rank.

The SII is the gradient of the resulting fitted line, and could be positive or negative
according to the indicator polarity. Since the relative ranks, by definition, range from
0 to 1, the SII is the difference between the fitted value at  \code{x=1} and  \code{x=0}.

The RII is the ratio of the fitted value at  \code{x=1,Y1} and the fitted value at
  \code{x=0,Y0}.  which can be calculated as:  \code{RII = (Y0 + SII)/Y0}
}

\section{Function arguments}{

The indicator type can be specified via the \code{value_type} parameter. Transformations
can be applied to the indicator value and its confidence limits before calculating the
standard error in cases where the confidence interval around the indicator value is
likely to be non-symmetric. This is a log transformation for rates, and logit for
proportions.

If the standard error is supplied directly to the function from the input dataset,
this is used instead of calculating one from the indicator confidence limits.
}

\section{Warning}{

The SII calculation assumes a linear relationship between indicator value and quantile,
and small populations within quantiles can make it unstable.

This function does not include checks for linearity or stability; it is the user's responsibility
to ensure the input data is suitable for the SII calculation.

\section{Notes}{
 this function is using nest and unnest functions from tidyr version 1.0.0.
